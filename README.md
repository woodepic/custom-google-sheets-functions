# custom-google-sheets-functions
This is where I'll put some functions I make to use with google sheets


How to use these functions:
* Create a new google sheets file
* Use the menu at the top to go to Extensions>Apps Script
* Create a new .gs file if it has not already
* Paste these functions
* Now you can use it in google sheets! (For example =compoundInterest(<PARAMS>) in a cell)
